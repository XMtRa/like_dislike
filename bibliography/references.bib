  abstract = {We review different streams of social science literature on privacy with the goal of understanding consumer privacy decision making and deriving implications for policy. We focus on psychological and economic factors influencing both consumers' desire and consumers' ability to protect their privacy, either through individual action or through the implementation of regulations applying to firms. Contrary to depictions of online sharing behaviors as careless, we show how consumers fundamentally care about online privacy, and present evidence of numerous actions they take to protect it. However, we also document how prohibitively difficult it is to attain desired, or even desirable, levels of privacy through individual action alone. The remaining instrument for privacy protection is policy intervention. However, again for both psychological and economic reasons, the collective impetus for adequate intervention is often countervailed by powerful interests that oppose it.},

  abstract = {In the recent decades, privacy scholarship has made significant progress. Most of it was achieved in monodisciplinary works. However, privacy has a deeply interdisciplinary nature. Most importantly, societies as well as individuals experience privacy as being influenced by legal, technical, and social norms and structures. In this article, we hence attempt to connect insights of different academic disciplines into a joint model, an Interdisciplinary Privacy and Communication Model. The model differentiates four different elements: communication context, protection needs, threat and risk analysis, as well as protection enforcement. On the one hand, with this model, we aim to describe how privacy unfolds. On the other hand, the model also prescribes how privacy can be furnished and regulated. As such, the model contributes to a general understanding of privacy as a theoretical guide and offers a practical basis to address new challenges of the digital age.},

In Study 1, 515 people completed an 82-item questionnaire from which the three scales were derived. In Study 2, scale validity was examined by comparing scores of individuals drawn from groups considered likely to differ in privacy-protective behaviors. In Study 3, correlations between the scores on the current scales and two established measures of privacy concern were examined. The authors conclude that these scales are reliable and valid instruments suitable for administration via the Internet, and present them for use in online privacy research.},

We found a significant effect in the same direction as in the original study for 11 replications (61\%); on average, the replicated effect size is 66\% of the original. The replicability rate varies between 67\% and 78\% for four additional replicability indicators, including a prediction market measure of peer beliefs.}

Ultimately, the DPM provides a framework that advances disclosure theory and identifies strategies that can assist disclosers in maximizing the likelihood that disclosure will benefit well-being.}

  abstract = {This paper intends to remind communication scientists that the indirect effect as estimated in mediation analyses is a statistical synonym for omitted variable bias (i.e. confounding or suppression). This simple fact questions the interpretability of statistically significant ‘indirect effects’ when using observational data: in social reality, all variables correlate with each other to some extent – the so-called ‘crud factor’ – which means that omitted variable bias and ‘indirect effects’ at the population level are virtually guaranteed regardless of the actual variables involved in the statistical mediation model. As a result, there can be no inferential link between the observation of a significant indirect effect and a theoretical claim of mediation. Through this argument, the paper hopes to add to the existing warnings on mediation analyses and cultivate a more critical interpretation of ‘indirect effects’ in communication science.},

A Web-based survey revealed that there are differences by gender, race, and age even among this wired group. Drawing from literature on technology adoption, the digital divide, and self-determination theory, this study found that psychological factors–perceived competence and both extrinsic and intrinsic motivations–predict content creation. Among the experience variables, having a computer in the students' own room is associated with content creation when controlling for all other factors. The gender divide disappears when experience, skills, perceived competence, and intrinsic motivation are considered. Finally, a new racial gap emerged; whites are less likely than minorities to participate in the Web even after controlling for all other variables.An earlier version of this paper received an award in the Jung-Sook Lee Student Paper Competition of the Communication and Technology Division, Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication annual conference, Boston, August, 2009.

  abstract = {Facebook is a well-known computer-mediated communication platform considered popular among adolescents and young adults. New media scholars have coined the term “intensity of Facebook use” (IFU) for the concept that measures the emotional and affective attitude towards Facebook use among young people. IFU is an important service use concept that has been positively linked with the different psychosocial outcomes of student well-being. However, only a limited amount of the prior literature has investigated the relationship between IFU and different Facebook uses and gratifications (U\&G). The existing literature suggests inconsistent findings with a sole emphasis on young adults. To address these gaps, the present study has investigated the differential role of different Facebook U\&G among adolescents and young adults in predicting IFU. A total of three cross-sectional data sets (N=373, 107, 105) represented adolescents and university-attending young-adult Facebook users. The study results suggest that process U\&G do and content U\&G do not play any significant role in predicting IFU. Adolescents and young adults differ in their sought Facebook U\&G. In addition to this, cultural differences were observed in the sought Facebook U\&G and their differential role in predicting IFU.},

(2020) conclude that “the ‘privacy paradox’ phenomenon (...) exists in our research model” (p. 8). In this comment, we contest this conclusion and present evidence and arguments against it. We find five areas of problems: (1) Flawed logic of hypothesis testing; (2) erroneous and implausible results; (3) questionable decision to use only the direct effect of privacy concerns on disclosure behavior as evidence in testing the privacy paradox; (4) overinterpreting results from MASEM; (5) insufficient reporting and lack of transparency. To guide future research, we offer three recommendations: Going beyond mere null hypothesis significance testing, probing alternative theoretical models, and implementing open science practices. While we value this meta-analytic effort, we caution its readers that, contrary to the authors’ claim, it does not offer evidence in support of the privacy paradox.},

Using a representative sample of the German population, which includes 1403 respondents who were interviewed at three waves separated by 6 months, we investigate the privacy paradox from a longitudinal perspective, differentiating between-person relations from within-person effects. Results of a cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts revealed that people who were more concerned about their online privacy than others also shared slightly less personal information online and had substantially more negative attitudes toward information sharing (between-person level). Next, people who were more concerned than usual also shared slightly less information than usual (within-person level). At the same time, we found no long-term effects of privacy concerns on information sharing or attitudes 6 months later. Together, the results provide further evidence against the privacy paradox.},

It is currently untested, however, how this transactional process operates at the within-person level-where these causal processes take place. Dutch adolescents (n~=~244, Mage ~=~13.84, 38.50\% boys) reported three times on perceived parental privacy invasion and secrecy. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPM) confirmed earlier findings. Privacy invasion predicted increased secrecy, but a reverse effect was found from increased secrecy to increased privacy invasion. Controlling for confounding positive group-level associations with a novel random intercept CLPM, negative within-person associations were found. Higher levels of secrecy predicted lower levels of privacy invasive behaviors at the within-person level. These opposing findings within- versus between-persons illustrate a Simpson's paradox.}

Regression analyses conducted on results from a survey of undergraduate students (N = 286) suggest a strong association between use of Facebook and the three types of social capital, with the strongest relationship being to bridging social capital. In addition, Facebook usage was found to interact with measures of psychological well-being, suggesting that it might provide greater benefits for users experiencing low self-esteem and low life satisfaction.},

  abstract = {This paper begins to answer the call to broaden current theories of individual decision-making by including in them the effects of human mood. Grounding our arguments in psychological literature on the effects of mood on information processing, motivation, and decision heuristics, we develop hypotheses about how mood can significantly affect individuals' use of structured decision protocols. In support of our hypotheses, results from an experimental study of complex decision-making suggest that, in situations where a structured decision protocol is the usual method of decision-making, individuals in moderately negative moods are significantly more likely than those in moderately positive moods to: (1) carefully execute all the steps of a structured decision protocol, (2) execute the steps of a structured decision protocol in the correct order, and (3) rely on the outcome of the structured decision protocol as the primary basis for the decision. We discuss these findings in terms of their implications for both organizational decision models and psychological models of mood and decision-making. In general, our findings help establish mood as an important variable in models of organizational decision-making and help shed light on often conflicting findings about the benefits of positive vs. negative mood for individual decision-making.},

  abstract = {The problem of false positives and negatives has received considerable attention in behavioral research in recent years. The current paper uses video game violence research as an example of how such issues may develop in a field. Despite decades of research, evidence on whether violent video games (VVGs) contribute to aggression in players has remained mixed. Concerns have been raised in recent years that experiments regarding VVGs may suffer from both "false positives" and "false negatives." The current paper examines this issue in three sets of video game experiments, two sets of video game experiments on aggression and prosocial behaviors identified in meta-analysis, and a third group of recent null studies. Results indicated that studies of VVGs and aggression appear to be particularly prone to false positive results. Studies of VVGs and prosocial behavior, by contrast are heterogeneous and did not demonstrate any indication of false positive results. However, their heterogeneous nature made it difficult to base solid conclusions on them. By contrast, evidence for false negatives in null studies was limited, and little evidence emerged that null studies lacked power in comparison those highlighted in past meta-analyses as evidence for effects. These results are considered in light of issues related to false positives and negatives in behavioral science more broadly.},

Two Monte Carlo simulation experiments show that multicollinearity can cause problems under certain conditions, specifically: (1) when multicollinearity is extreme, Type II error rates are generally unacceptably high (over 80\%), (2) when multicollinearity is between 0.6 and 0.8, Type II error rates can be substantial (greater than 50\% and frequently above 80\%) if composite reliability is weak, explained variance (R2) is low, and sample size is relatively small. However, as reliability improves (0.80 or higher), explained variance R2 reaches 0.75, and sample becomes relatively large, Type II error rates become negligible. (3) When multicollinearity is between 0.4 and 0.5, Type II error rates tend to be quite small, except when reliability is weak, R2 is low, and sample size is small, in which case error rates can still be high (greater than 50\%). Methods for detecting and correcting multicollinearity are briefly discussed. However, since multicollinearity is difficult to manage after the fact, researchers should avoid problems by carefully managing the factors known to mitigate multicollinearity problems (particularly measurement error).},

  abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is believed by many to overcome the problems associated with the use of cross-lagged correlations as a way to study causal influences in longitudinal panel data. The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, time-invariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the CLPM fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.}

The study postulates and tests the validity of a model  based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), including antecedent factors of attitude and perceived behavioral  control (PBC). A survey was conducted among 1,042 respondents. Results from SEM analyses show that the  hypothesized model fits the empirical data well. The model accounts for 61.9 percent of the variance in adolescents’  intention to disclose and 43.7 percent of the variance in self-reported disclosure. Perceived social  pressure exerted by significant others (subjective norm) is the most important TPB factor in predicting intention  to disclose personal information in exchange for incentives. This finding suggests that in discussions of adolescents’  information privacy, the importance of social factors outweighs the individually oriented TPB factors of  attitude and PBC. Moreover, privacy concern and trust propensity are significant predictors of respondents’  attitudes toward online disclosure in exchange for commercial incentives, whereas the frequency of Internet use  significantly affects their level of PBC.},

Previous studies on computer-mediated communication and computer-supported cooperative work suggest that the higher utilization of ICT for supporting collaborative work is largely dependent on the business strategy, which promotes trust among parties. Our focus is on understanding the effect of virtual organizing for achieving higher collaboration in virtual settings. We identify the challenges for developing trust in a virtual collaborative environment. We describe how the process for virtual organizing helps promote higher levels of collaboration among parties in geographically dispersed locations. We posit that virtual organizing helps support creating, sustaining and deploying key intellectual and knowledge assets while sourcing tangible, physical assets in a complex network of relationships. Our analysis demonstrates that the real challenge for the management of virtual collaboration is trust and has to be guided by a shared business principle or shared vision. Eight propositions are offered based on this analysis. We conclude that virtual organizing as presented here suggests a set of rules and norms enabling and constraining actions that promote a desired and required higher level of trust. This, in turn, is critical (a) to the development and sustainability of virtual collaboration and (b) to ensure the optimal use of ICT.},

Second, we describe how raw language data can be accessed and quantified for inclusion in subsequent analyses, exploring personality as expressed on Facebook to illustrate. Third, we highlight challenges and issues to be considered, including accessing and processing the data, interpreting effects, and ethical issues.

Previous research tested this assumption by conducting conventional multivariate procedures, including path analysis or structural equation modeling. However, these analytical approaches cannot account for the potential conjoint effects of risk and benefit perceptions. In this paper, we use a novel analytical approach called polynomial regressions with response surface analysis (RSA) to investigate potential non-linear and conjoint effects based on three data sets (N1 = 344, N2 = 561, N3 = 1.131). In all three datasets, we find that people self-disclose more when gratifications exceed concerns. In two datasets, we also find that self-disclosure increases when both risk and benefit perceptions are on higher rather than lower levels, suggesting that gratifications play an important role in determining whether and how risk considerations will factor into the decision to disclose information.},

By integrating the theory of belief updating and an extended privacy trade-off model from a longitudinal perspective as the basis for theoretical underpinning, this study proposes a privacy trade-off model showing the role of initial use and initial self-disclosure on updating users' pre-perceptions of using a new SNA to initial perceptions of using it. The trade-off between pre-privacy concern and pre-perceived benefit determines the initial SNA usage and self-disclosure behaviors. Then, initial privacy trade-off determines the continued use behavior and continued self-disclosure. Using an empirical data collected three phases from actual mobile app users, this study validates the proposed model and hypotheses. Including the proposed dynamic model of privacy trade-off, this study provides important contributions to theory and practice in the privacy literature.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88\% of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95\% of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85\% of cases. For the personality trait "Openness," prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

While the affordances of contemporary social media applications help to indulge this urge, they also pose a significant challenge. People are usually good at leveraging self-disclosure in a way that gratifications are increased and disadvantages are minimized — for example, by avoiding pitfalls such as revealing too intimate information to a large audience. However, when trying to balance self-disclosure gratifications and privacy risks on social media platforms, users are not always able to take rational decisions as suggested in the ‘privacy calculus’ approach. Instead, recent research indicates that users are prone to biases which hinder rational calculations of advantages and disadvantages — especially caused by social media cues. Users therefore need to be supported in order to master self-disclosure decisions.},

We find that users are primarily motivated to disclose information because of the convenience of maintaining and developing relationships and platform enjoyment. Countervailing these benefits, privacy risks represent a critical barrier to information disclosure. However, users’ perception of risk can be mitigated by their trust in the network provider and availability of control options.

With this study, we ask whether individuals’ online privacy concerns increase and online information disclosure decreases if they experience such a worst-case scenario. Using representative data from a five-wave panel study (n = 745), we found that people who generally experience more privacy violations also have stronger privacy concerns (between-person differences). However, people who experienced more privacy violations than usual in the last 6 months were only slightly more concerned afterward and did not change their disclosure behavior afterward (within-person effects). The need for privacy moderated these processes. We untangle under which circumstances such experiences may be transformative, and discuss practical and conceptual consequences of how experiences translate into concerns, but not necessarily behaviors.},

Some of the inconsistencies in published findings may be explained by a strong heterogeneity in the conceptual and analytical choices that researchers implement when investigating the privacy paradox. Based on representative survey data of the 27 EU member states (2011: n = 8,962; 2015: n = 10,526; 2019: n = 11,428), I investigated the effect of conceptual and analytical decisions on ‘finding’ the privacy paradox. Specification curve analyses revealed that the magnitude and statistical significance of the relationship between privacy concerns and information disclosure is contingent on the operationalization of the independent variable, the inclusion of covariates, and the age of the studied population. The relationship between online privacy concerns and using social media privacy settings, in contrast, was less influenced by analytical decisions. Yet, the relationship was stronger in younger people and increased over time. The findings call for more transparency in analyzing research data. Evaluating the implications of analytical choices will help to establish best practices and advance cumulative knowledge creation in privacy research.},

So far, empirical studies investigated the privacy calculus on a between-person level and, therefore, were not able to make statements about the intrapersonal psychological processes. In the present preregistered online within-person experiment, participants (N?=?485) were asked to imagine three different disclosure situations in which privacy risks were indicated by a privacy score. As personality variables, rational and intuitive privacy decision-making styles and privacy resignation were assessed. Results of a within-between random effects model showed that benefit perceptions were positively associated with self-disclosure intentions on between- and within-person levels. The privacy score was found to be effective in supporting users to make more privacy aware choices (within-person level). Finally, the rational decision-making style was positively related to privacy risk perception, while especially intuitive decision-makers can benefit from decision-making aids like the privacy score.},

  abstract = {Our society is increasingly relying on the digitized, aggregated opinions of others to make decisions. We therefore designed and analyzed a large-scale randomized experiment on a social news aggregation Web site to investigate whether knowledge of such aggregates distorts decision-making. Prior ratings created significant bias in individual rating behavior, and positive and negative social influences created asymmetric herding effects. Whereas negative social influence inspired users to correct manipulated ratings, positive social influence increased the likelihood of positive ratings by 32\% and created accumulating positive herding that increased final ratings by 25\% on average. This positive herding was topic-dependent and affected by whether individuals were viewing the opinions of friends or enemies. A mixture of changing opinion and greater turnout under both manipulations together with a natural tendency to up-vote on the site combined to create the herding effects. Such findings will help interpret collective judgment accurately and avoid social influence bias in collective intelligence in the future.}

Scholars primarily use self-report measures of the quantity or duration of media use as proxies for more objective measures, but the validity of these self-reports remains unclear. Advancements in data collection techniques have produced a collection of studies indexing both self-reported and log-based measures. To assess the alignment between these measures, we conducted a pre-registered meta-analysis of this research. Based on 106 effect sizes, we found that self-reported media use correlates only moderately with logged measurements, that self-reports were rarely an accurate reflection of logged media use and that measures of problematic media use show an even weaker association with usage logs. These findings raise concerns about the validity of findings relying solely on self-reported measures of media use.},

As graduate students, we had great fun planning, conducting, and writing this research (Petty \& Cacioppo, 1977). We enjoyed arguing with each other at our initial meeting in 1973 and have sub­ sequently become best friends, but neither of us suspected at the time that we would or could actively maintain a research collaboration over the next decade, or that we would now find ourselves in a position to write this monograph. As we note in Chapter 1, we began our studies of persuasion at a time when social psychology was in "crisis," and interest in research on attitude change in particular was declining. As we write this, we are aware of six new volumes on persuasion that are in press or in preparation and that should appear over the next few years. In retrospect, it is not so surprising that research on attitudes and persuasion would reemerge as a central concern of social psychology. We believe that human feelings, beliefs, and behaviors, whether in the domain of interpersonal relations (e. g. , marriage, aggression), politics (e. g. , voting, revolution), health (e. g. , following a medical regimen), or economics (e. g. , consumer purchases) are greatly influenced by the evaluations people have of other people, objects, and issues. Furthermore, evaluations (attitudes) are influenced by affect, cognition, and behavior.},

  abstract = {Cyber security often depends on decisions made by human operators, who are commonly considered a major cause of security failures. We conducted 2 behavioral experiments to explore whether and how cyber security decision-making responses depend on gain–loss framing and salience of a primed recall prior experience. In Experiment I, we employed a 2~×~2 factorial design, manipulating the frame (gain vs. loss) and the presence versus absence of a prior near-miss experience. Results suggest that the experience of a near-miss significantly increased respondents’ endorsement of safer response options under a gain frame. Overall, female respondents were more likely to select a risk averse (safe) response compared with males. Experiment II followed the same general paradigm, framing all consequences in a loss frame and manipulating recall to include one of three possible prior experiences: false alarm, near-miss, or a hit involving a loss of data. Results indicate that the manipulated prior hit experience significantly increased the likelihood of respondents’ endorsement of a safer response relative to the manipulated prior near-miss experience. Conversely, the manipulated prior false-alarm experience significantly decreased respondents’ likelihood of endorsing a safer response relative to the manipulated prior near-miss experience. These results also showed a main effect for age and were moderated by respondent’s income level.},

Although the causes and solutions are varied, we focus here on a common logical problem in inference. The default mode of inference is significance testing, which has a free lunch property where researchers need not make detailed assumptions about the alternative to test the null hypothesis. We present the argument that there is no free lunch; that is, valid testing requires that researchers test the null against a well-specified alternative. We show how this requirement follows from the basic tenets of conventional and Bayesian probability. Moreover, we show in both the conventional and Bayesian framework that not specifying the alternative may lead to rejections of the null hypothesis with scant evidence. We review both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to specifying alternatives, and we show how such specifications improve inference. The field of cognitive science will benefit because consideration of reasonable alternatives will undoubtedly sharpen the intellectual underpinnings of research.}

The current three-wave panel study with a four-month interval among N\,=\,1,032 adolescents tests this moderating role of social media literacy. Specifically, we examine between- vs. within-person relations of exposure to the positivity bias on social media, social comparison, envy, and inspiration. We find significant positive relations between these variables at the between-person level. At the within-person level, a different pattern of results occurred: higher exposure to others’ perfect lives on social media was related to increased inspiration, and higher social comparison was related to increased envy, yet both associations only occurred in one of the two time intervals. Additionally, no within-person associations between exposure to positive content and envy were significant, nor between exposure and social comparison or social comparison and inspiration. These results thus seem more complex than traditional paradigms of selective and transactional media effects assume. Furthermore, multiple group tests showed that the within-person cross-lagged relation between social comparison and envy only occurred for adolescents with low affective social media literacy. The moderating role of social media literacy was not supported in any other instances. The results overall point at the need to instruct affective social media literacy to help adolescents navigate positively biased social media platforms in a healthy way.},

  abstract = {We conducted a randomized-controlled experiment with 201 participants to investigate the effects of relationship closeness, emotions, and the receipt of Likes on reciprocal Liking behaviors. We found that individuals engaged in interchange-oriented social grooming by giving Likes to close friends regardless of whether they had received Likes from them before. However, when relationship closeness was low, participants mirrored their acquaintances’ behavior by reciprocating Likes for Likes. Additionally, high-arousal positive emotions mediated the effects of receiving Likes on the intention to Like other users’ content, but this result only held true when relational closeness was not accounted for in the model. Our study explains why people give Likes on social media and what factors shape their Liking intentions. The results of our study contribute to the existing knowledge of the social norm of reciprocity, social grooming, emotion regulation, relational closeness, and social media Liking.The study investigates whether social media users reciprocate Likes from close friends and acquaintances and what role emotions play in this process. We conducted an online experiment and allocated participants to one of the following groups: receiving a Like from a close friend, not receiving a Like from a close friend, receiving a Like from an acquaintance, and not receiving a Like from an acquaintance. We found that people tend to return Likes for Likes and that individuals feel excited and enthusiastic after receiving a Like from another user. We also discovered that this emotional response prompts them to Like that user’s content in the future. However, the results suggest that relational closeness plays a more important role than emotions in Likes reciprocation. Specifically, people are motivated by relationship maintenance rather than reciprocity when it comes to close friendship. When a person sees a post shared by their close friend, they tend to Like it, even if this close friend did not Like that person’s previous post. When it comes to acquaintances, people are driven by the social norm of reciprocity and tend to give Likes only to those who Liked their content before. Hence, the study clarified the role of emotions and relational closeness in the reciprocation of Likes on social media.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the presence and magnitude of gender differences in privacy-seeking tendencies on social network sites (SNS). To do so, a meta-analytic approach was chosen. A literature review produced a sample of 61 effect sizes from 37 independent studies (N\,=\,16,159,261). Results showed that females on social network sites displayed higher privacy concerns and behaviors than did males. The gender differences, while all pointing to females being more committed to enhancing privacy, were small and statistically heterogeneous. A clear gender difference was apparent for activating privacy settings (d\,=\,0.35) and untagging photographs (d\,=\,0.26), whereas privacy concerns (d\,=\,0.13) and disclosure of personal information (d\,=\,0.13) showed smaller gender differences. The findings are in line with both evolutionary and social role theories and may be explained by differences in personality, threat vulnerability, or SNS activity levels. Advocators of SNS privacy should target males as the more vulnerable segment to privacy breaches. Additional studies are needed to investigate the moderating effects of variables such as culture and age, and to clarify the basis of this gender difference.},

  abstract = {Once they have learnt about the effects of collinearity on the output of multiple regression models, researchers may unduly worry about these and resort to (sometimes dubious) modelling techniques to mitigate them. I argue that, to the extent that problems occur in the presence of collinearity, they are not caused by it but rather by common mental shortcuts that researchers take when interpreting statistical models and that can also lead them astray in the absence of collinearity. Moreover, I illustrate that common strategies for dealing with collinearity only sidestep the perceived problem by biasing parameter estimates, reformulating the model in such a way that it maps onto different research questions, or both. I conclude that collinearity in itself is not a problem and that researchers should be aware of what their approaches for addressing it actually achieve.},

Currently available guidance primarily consists of sample size rules of thumb that are not backed up by research, and power analyses for detecting model misfit. Missing from most current practices is power analysis to detect a target effect (e.g., a regression coefficient between latent variables). In this paper we (a) distinguish power to detect model misspecification from power to detect a target effect, (b) report the results of a simulation study on power to detect a target regression coefficient in a 3-predictor latent regression model, and (c) introduce a Shiny app, pwrSEM, for user-friendly power analysis for detecting target effects in structural equation models.},

Written with humor and for a variety of readers, this book identifies simple properties and axioms of human communication and demonstrates how all communications are actually a function of their contexts.},

By applying uses and gratifications theory, this paper will explore and discuss the uses and gratifications that consumer receive from using social media. This paper seeks to provide a better and more comprehensive understanding of why consumers use social media. Design/methodology/approach – Exploratory study was conducted. 25 in‐depth interviews were conducted with individuals who use social media. Findings – This study identified ten uses and gratifications for using social media. The ten uses and gratifications are: social interaction, information seeking, pass time, entertainment, relaxation, communicatory utility, convenience utility, expression of opinion, information sharing, and surveillance/knowledge about others. Research limitations/implications – Limitations are small sample size. Research implications are that uses and gratifications theory has specific relevance to social media and should be given more prominence. Uses and gratifications theory helps explain the many and varied reasons why consumers use social media. Practical implications – This paper helps organizations to understand why consumers use social media and what gratifications they receive from social media. Originality/value – This paper makes the contribution that uses and gratifications theory has specific relevance and should be given more prominence within the area of social media. This paper also provides a rich and vivid understanding of why consumers use social media.},
