<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Likes or Dislikes, Gratifications or
Concerns? A One-Week Field Experiment Analyzing the Effects of
Popularity Cues on the Privacy Calculus in Online Communication</h1>
<div class="abstract">
<p class="abstract">Abstract</p>
<p>The privacy calculus model states that people weigh risks and
benefits before communicating online. This paper analyzes three open
questions. How robust is the privacy calculus, can it be replicated with
actual behavior in realistic online setting? Do we need to extend the
model by integrating more socio-psychological measures such as trust,
self-efficacy, and privacy deliberation? How easily can the privacy
calculus be be manipulated by external factors such as like and dislike
buttons? In a preregistered one-week field experiment (N = 590),
participants discussed a current political topic on an online website,
which included either (a) like buttons, (b) both like and dislike
buttons, or (c) no buttons. The privacy calculus model was confirmed:
Benefits and concerns affected communication. Deliberating about privacy
by comparing benefits and risks decreased communication. Experiencing
self-efficacy and trust increased communication. Implementing both like
and dislike buttons had a strong effect on behavior: It reduced online
communication by 45 percent.</p>
</div>

</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>According to the privacy paradox, the way users share information
online is erratic <span class="citation">(Barnes 2006)</span>: People
communicate much personal information online, although being strongly
concerned about their privacy <span class="citation">(Taddicken and Jers
2011)</span>. However, despite its popularity in both academic research
<span class="citation">(Dienlin 2019)</span> and the public press <span
class="citation">(New York Public Radio 2018)</span>, empirical support
for the privacy paradox is tenuous <span class="citation">(Baruh,
Secinti, and Cemalcilar 2017; Dienlin and Sun 2021)</span>. Research is
increasingly building on the privacy calculus model, which states that
communication online can be explained by perceived risks and expected
benefits <span class="citation">(Bol et al. 2018; Krasnova et al. 2010;
Meier and Krämer 2022)</span>.</p>
<p>Although the privacy calculus has gained momentum in academic
research, several important questions remain unanswered. First, the
privacy calculus’ empirical foundation needs to be improved <span
class="citation">(Knijnenburg et al. 2017)</span>. To date, much
research on the privacy calculus builds on (a) self-reports of behavior
<span class="citation">(Krasnova et al. 2010)</span>, (b) vignette
approaches <span class="citation">(Bol et al. 2018)</span>, or (c)
one-shot experiments in the lab <span class="citation">(Trepte,
Scharkow, and Dienlin 2020)</span>. Self-reports are often unreliable
measures of online behavior <span class="citation">(Parry et al.
2021)</span>, vignette approaches have limited external validity, and
one-shot experiments cannot analyze compound effects of sustained use.
The first aim is therefore to replicate the privacy calculus model in a
more authentic and long-term setting using actual behavioral data. Doing
so will show its robustness, and it will help understand if behavior is
better explained by the privacy paradox approach or by the privacy
calculus model.</p>
<p>Second, the privacy calculus model is criticized for neglecting the
actual process of weighing pros and cons, and for over-emphasizing
rationality <span class="citation">(Knijnenburg et al. 2017)</span>.
Simply showing that both concerns and gratifications correlate with
communication online does not prove that an explicit weighing process
took place. Instead, we need to find out if people deliberately compare
costs and benefits before communicating online. Therefore, I will also
analyze the process of comparing pros and cons explicitly, by
elaborating on what I will call the the privacy deliberation process
<span class="citation">(Omarzu 2000)</span>. Next, focusing exclusively
on costs and benefits does not fully capture how and why users engage
online. I, hence, extend the privacy calculus by analyzing how online
communication is affected by trust and self-efficacy, two variables less
focused on rationality and more oriented toward socio-psychological
aspects <span class="citation">(Metzger 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>Online behavior is determined by the person itself and their external
circumstances <span class="citation">(Bazarova and Masur 2020; Trepte,
Scharkow, and Dienlin 2020; Spottswood and Hancock 2017)</span>. The
privacy calculus upholds that much of behavior is rational and
self-determined, but how easily can this process be manipulated by
external circumstances? Online contexts are optimized to elicit as much
interaction as possible <span class="citation">(Ellison and Vitak 2015;
Masur, DiFranzo, and Bazarova 2021)</span>, for example via low
threshold communication features such as likes, shares, replies, or
reactions <span class="citation">(Carr, Hayes, and Sumner 2018)</span>.
Implicit and explicit cues on how a website is used can increase
self-disclosure <span class="citation">(Spottswood and Hancock 2017;
Trepte, Scharkow, and Dienlin 2020)</span>. How large are the effects of
external popularity cues such as like and dislike buttons compared to
the internal weighing of pros and cons? And how easily can the privacy
calculus be manipulated by popularity cues?</p>
<div id="replicating-the-privacy-calculus" class="section level2">
<h2>Replicating the Privacy Calculus</h2>
<p>The privacy calculus analyzes why people communicate online. When are
we willing to engage in a conversation? It builds on the calculus of
behavior <span class="citation">(Laufer and Wolfe 1977)</span> and
states that people are weighing risks and benefits before engaging in
communication. Communication is closely related to privacy, which is
defined as a “voluntary and temporary withdrawal of a person from the
general society” <span class="citation">(Westin 1967, 7)</span>. People
regulate their privacy by deciding what and what not to communicate
<span class="citation">(Dienlin 2014)</span>. Disclosing information can
be risky, and if people are more concerned about their privacy they are
less likely to communicate online <span class="citation">(Baruh,
Secinti, and Cemalcilar 2017; Krasnova et al. 2010; Masur 2023; Meier
and Krämer 2022)</span>. According to a meta-analysis by <span
class="citation">Baruh, Secinti, and Cemalcilar (2017)</span>, the
effect is small but significant (<em>r</em> = -.13).</p>
<p>Outweighing concerns, the most relevant drivers of online
communication are expected gratifications <span
class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger 2016; Bol et al. 2018; Kezer,
Dienlin, and Baruh 2022)</span>. People are happy to trade in parts of
their privacy when they can receive something more valuable in return
<span class="citation">(Laufer and Wolfe 1977)</span>. In online
communication, the most important benefits include social support <span
class="citation">(Krasnova et al. 2010)</span>, social capital <span
class="citation">(Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe 2007)</span>,
entertainment <span class="citation">(Dhir and Tsai 2017)</span>,
information-seeking <span class="citation">(Whiting and Williams
2013)</span>, and self-presentation <span class="citation">(Min and Kim
2015)</span>.</p>
<p>H1: People who are more concerned about their privacy are less likely
to communicate actively on a website.</p>
<p>H2: People who obtain more gratifications from using a website are
more likely to communicate actively on a website.</p>
</div>
<div id="extending-the-privacy-calculus" class="section level2">
<h2>Extending the Privacy Calculus</h2>
<p>Although privacy calculus implies that people explicitly compare
benefits and risks before communicating online, prior research has
neglected this aspect <span class="citation">(Knijnenburg et al.
2017)</span>. Only observing that privacy concerns or expected
gratifications and communication online are related does not prove that
an explicit weighing process took place <span
class="citation">(Knijnenburg et al. 2017)</span>. Instead, we need to
analyze if, and if so by how much, people actively deliberate about
their privacy, and whether doing so influences their decision to
communicate. Self-disclosure theory <span class="citation">(Omarzu 2000;
Altman 1976)</span> suggests that if the benefits of communication are
attractive, deciding whether or not to communicate is a “conscious and
deliberative process” <span class="citation">(Omarzu 2000, 183)</span>.
I hence introduce and investigate a novel concept termed <em>privacy
deliberation</em>. Privacy deliberation captures the extent to which
individuals explicitly compare risks and benefits before communicating
with others.</p>
<p>How could deliberating about one’s privacy affect communication? On
the one hand, it could reduce subsequent communication. Refraining from
communication—the primary means of connecting with others <span
class="citation">(Altman 1976)</span>—often requires restraint <span
class="citation">(Omarzu 2000)</span>. This is especially true for
social media, which are designed to foster communication and
participation <span class="citation">(Ellison and Vitak 2015; Masur,
DiFranzo, and Bazarova 2021)</span>. Actively thinking about whether
communicating is worthwhile might be the first step not to participate.
On the other hand, deliberating about privacy might also increase
communication. In light of the numerous benefits mentioned above, it
might make sense to conclude that participation is beneficial, thereby
fostering communication <span class="citation">(Krasnova et al.
2010)</span>.</p>
<p>RQ1: Do people who deliberate more actively about their privacy
communicate more or less online?</p>
<p>The aforementioned weighing process is not flawless or perfect. It is
useful to understand the privacy calculus from the perspective of
<em>bounded rationality</em> <span class="citation">(Simon 1990)</span>.
Bounded rationality states that “(1) humans are cognitively constrained;
(2) these constraints impact decision making; and (3) difficult problems
reveal the constraints and highlight their significance.” <span
class="citation">(Bendor 2015, 1303)</span>. Importantly, although human
behavior is <em>partly</em> irrational, bounded rationality does not
state that it is <em>completely</em> irrational <span
class="citation">(Gigerenzer, Selten, and Workshop 2002)</span>.
Rationality is a continuum. In the context of online privacy,
rationality is impeded by information asymmetries, presence bias,
intangibility, illusory control, or herding <span
class="citation">(Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein 2020)</span>.
It follows that to provide a more complete picture, additional factors
next to gratifications and concerns should also explain communication.
Factors less focused on rationality, but more on socio-psychological
aspects.</p>
<p>Prior research suggests that perhaps the following two factors are
most important when it comes to understanding online communication:
self-efficacy and trust <span class="citation">(Correa 2010; Hossain and
Wigand 2004; Metzger 2004)</span>. For example, if users are more
familiar, experienced, and knowledgeable in a given online context, they
are more likely to navigate that online contexts successfully and to
communicate actively <span class="citation">(Baruh, Secinti, and
Cemalcilar 2017; Krämer and Schäwel 2020)</span>. People with more
privacy self-efficacy also engage more successfully in self-withdrawal
<span class="citation">(Dienlin and Metzger 2016)</span>. Hence, if
users possess more self-efficacy to participate, they should also
communicate more.</p>
<p>H3: People are more likely to communicate on a website when their
self-efficacy to actively use the website is higher.</p>
<p>In all situations where people lack experience, control, or
competence, a central variable to understand behavior is trust <span
class="citation">(Gefen, Karahanna, and Straub 2003)</span>. Especially
in online contexts, trust plays a key role <span
class="citation">(Metzger 2004)</span>. Users often cannot control the
environment or the way their information is handled <span
class="citation">(Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein 2020; Bräunlich
et al. 2020)</span>. Trust either captures “<em>specific</em> beliefs
dealing primarily with the integrity, benevolence, and ability of
another party” <span class="citation">(Gefen, Karahanna, and Straub
2003, 55, emphasis added)</span> or a “<em>general</em> belief that
another party can be trusted” <span class="citation">(Gefen, Karahanna,
and Straub 2003, 55, emphasis added)</span>. In online contexts, there
are different targets of trust, including (a) the information system,
(b) the provider, (c) the Internet, and (d) the community of other users
<span class="citation">(Söllner, Hoffmann, and Leimeister 2016)</span>.
People who put more trust in the providers of networks, for example,
disclose more personal information <span class="citation">(Li
2011)</span>.</p>
<p>H4: People are more likely to communicate on a website when they have
greater trust in the provider, the website, and the other users.</p>

<div id="analyzing-the-impact-of-popularity-cues"
class="section level2">
<h2>Analyzing the Impact of Popularity Cues</h2>
<p>How are the privacy calculus and communication affected by the
context, the digital infrastructure? How easily can the calculus be
manipulated externally? One of the central tools to afford and govern
online behavior are popularity cues such as like and dislike buttons
<span class="citation">(Stsiampkouskaya, Joinson, and Piwek
2023)</span>. Popularity cues have been shown to affect behavior <span
class="citation">(Krämer and Schäwel 2020; Masur, DiFranzo, and Bazarova
2021; Trepte, Scharkow, and Dienlin 2020)</span>: Online comments that
already have several dislikes are more likely to receive further
dislikes <span class="citation">(Muchnik, Aral, and Taylor 2013)</span>.
When users disagree with a post, they are more likely to click on a
button labeled <em>respect</em> compared to a button labeled
<em>like</em> <span class="citation">(Stroud, Muddiman, and Scacco
2017)</span>.</p>
<p>How and why might popularity cues affect the privacy calculus? In
analyzing this question, it makes sense to analyze the cues’ underlying
affordances <span class="citation">(Ellison and Vitak 2015; Fox and
McEwan 2017)</span>. Affordances are mental representations of how
objects might be used. They emphasize that it is not the <em>objective
features</em> that determine behavior, but rather our <em>subjective
perceptions</em> <span class="citation">(Gibson 2015)</span>. There is
an ongoing debate on how to best understand and operationalize
affordances <span class="citation">(Evans et al. 2017)</span>. Whereas
<span class="citation">Evans et al. (2017)</span> propose three
affordances for mediated communication (i.e., anonymity, persistence,
and visibility), <span class="citation">Fox and McEwan (2017)</span>
suggest 10 affordances for SNSs alone (i.e., accessibility, bandwidth,
social presence, privacy, network association, personalization,
persistence, editability, conversation control, and anonymity).
Popularity cues such as like and dislike buttons, which are of primary
interest in this study, are understood as “paralinguistic digital
affordances” <span class="citation">(Carr, Hayes, and Sumner 2018,
142)</span>.</p>

Overview of analyzed model.
</p>
</div>
<p>Popularity cues likely impact the privacy calculus via two underlying
theoretical mechanisms <span class="citation">(Krämer and Schäwel
2020)</span>: First, the <em>mere presence</em> of popularity cues might
affect whether people are willing to disclose. Being able to attract
likes might afford active communication. The mere option to receive
dislikes, conversely, might inhibit communication. Second, <em>actually
receiving</em> likes or dislikes might affect behavior, by means of
positive reinforcement (likes) or punishment (dislikes) <span
class="citation">(Skinner 2014)</span>. To illustrate, likes are
affirmative and embody the positivity bias of social media <span
class="citation">(Schreurs, Meier, and Vandenbosch 2022)</span>.
Receiving a like online is similar to receiving a compliment offline
<span class="citation">(Carr, Hayes, and Sumner 2018; Sumner,
Ruge-Jones, and Alcorn 2017)</span>. Like-buttons afford and emphasize a
<em>gain frame</em> <span class="citation">(Rosoff, Cui, and John
2013)</span>. These gains can be garnered only through active
participation. Because like buttons emphasize positive outcomes, it is
likely that concerns decrease. In situations where there is more to win,
people might also more actively deliberate about whether or not to
communicate. Dislikes, instead, represent a punishment, introducing a
<em>loss frame</em>. Websites featuring both like <em>and</em> dislike
buttons should therefore be more ambivalent compared to websites without
popularity cues. Privacy concerns should not be reduced anymore: People
who are more concerned about their privacy are also more shy and risk
averse <span class="citation">(Dienlin 2017)</span>. Implementing the
dislike button might therefore increase privacy concerns, canceling out
the positive effects of the like button.</p>
<p>H5. People who use a website with like buttons (a) communicate more,
(b) obtain more gratifications, (c) are less concerned about their
privacy, and (d) deliberate more about whether they should communicate
online.</p>
<p>H6. People who use a website with like <em>and</em> dislike buttons
(a) communicate more, (b) obtain more gratifications, and (c) deliberate
more about whether they should communicate online.</p>
<p>H7. Compared to people who use a website with only like buttons,
people who use a website with like and dislike buttons (a) are more
concerned about their privacy, and (b) deliberate more about whether
they should communicate online.</p>

<h2>Open Science</h2>
<p>This manuscript features a <a
href="https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike">companion website</a>, which
includes the data, research materials, analysis scripts, and a
reproducible version of this manuscript (see <a
href="https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike"
class="uri">https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike</a>). The hypotheses,
sample size, research materials, analyses, and exclusion criteria were
preregistered (see <a
href="https://osf.io/a6tzc/?view_only=5d0ef9fe5e1745878cd1b19273cdf859"
class="uri">https://osf.io/a6tzc/?view_only=5d0ef9fe5e1745878cd1b19273cdf859</a>).
In some cases, the preregistered approach had to be changed (see <a
href="https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike/preregistration_changes">companion
website</a>). Analyses not preregistered are reported as exploratory
analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="procedure" class="section level2">
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>The study was designed as an online field experiment with three
different groups. The first experimental group used a website that
included like buttons; the second experimental group used an identical
website including both like and dislike buttons; and the control group
used an identical website without like and dislike buttons. Participants
were randomly distributed to one of the three websites in a
between-subject design.</p>
<p>The data were collected in Germany. Participants were recruited using
the professional panel agency Norstat. As incentive, participants were
awarded digital points, to receive special offers from online retailers.
Participants had to be above the age of 18 and had to live in Germany.
In a first step, the company sent its panel members an invitation to
participate in the study. In this invitation, panel members were asked
to participate in a study analyzing the current threat posed by
terrorist attacks in Germany. Members who agreed to participate were
sent the first questionnaire (<em>T1</em>). The questionnaire asked
participants about their sociodemographic background, (b) provided more
details about the study, and (c) included a registration link for the
website, which was introduced as “participation platform”. Afterward,
participants were randomly assigned to one of the three websites. After
registration was completed, participants were invited (but not obliged)
to visit the website and to discuss the topic of the terrorism threat in
Germany. Participants could use the website and write comments over the
course of one week. Subsequently, participants received a follow-up
questionnaire in which the self-reported measures reported below were
collected (<em>T2</em>).</p>

<p>The online website was programmed based on the open-source software
<em>discourse</em> (<a href="https://www.discourse.org/"
class="uri">https://www.discourse.org/</a>). To make sure the website
was professional and authentic, several pretests with students from the
local university were run. Nine hundred sixty participants created a
user account on the website (see below) and used the website actively.
Overall, they spent 162 hours online, wrote 1,171 comments, and clicked
on 560 popularity cues. All communication was checked, and there were no
instances of people providing meaningless text or doubting the
experiment. For a screenshot of the landing page and for examples of
comments, see Figure @ref(fig:website).</p>

<div id="participants" class="section level2">
<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>Sample size was determined using a priori power analyses. The power
analyses were based on estimates from the literature. When researching
aspects of privacy online <span class="citation">(e.g., Baruh, Secinti,
and Cemalcilar 2017)</span>, effects are often small <span
class="citation">(i.e., <em>r</em> = .10, Cohen 1992)</span>. Hence, the
minimum effect size was set to be <em>r</em> = .10. The aim was to be
able to detect this effect with a probability of at least 95% (i.e.,
power = 95%). Using the regular alpha level of 5%, power analyses
suggested a minimum sample size of <em>N</em> = 1,077. In the end, I was
able to include <em>N</em> = 559 in the analyses (see below), which was
significantly lower than the original aim. With this sample size, the
study had a power of 77% to find an effect at least as large as
<em>r</em> = .10. Sensitivity analyses showed that the current study
could still make reliable results (i.e., with a power of 95%) for
effects at least as large as <em>r</em> = .14. In conclusion, although
not as powerful as planned, the study is still adequately powered to
find the small effects reported in the privacy literature <span
class="citation">(Baruh, Secinti, and Cemalcilar 2017)</span>.</p>
<p>A quota sample that matched the German population in terms of age,
gender, and federal state was collected. In sum, 1,619 participants
completed the survey at T1; 960 participants created a user account on
the website; and 982 participants completed the survey at T2. The data
were connected using tokens and IP addresses. For technical reasons, the
data of several participants could not be matched (for example, because
they used different devices for the respective steps). In the end, the
data of 590 participants could be matched successfully. Considered
unreasonably fast, 29 participants were excluded who finished the
questionnaire at T2 in less than three minutes. To detect atypical data
and response patterns, Cook’s distance was calculated. I excluded 2
participants with clear response patterns (i.e., straight-lining). The
final sample included <em>N</em> = 559 participants. The sample
characteristics at T1 and T2 were as follows: T1: age = 45 years, gender
= 49% male, college degree = 22%. T2: age = 46 years, gender = 49% male,
college degree = 29%. One participant did not report their gender.</p>

<div id="measures" class="section level2">
<h2>Measures</h2>
<p>Factor validity was assessed using confirmatory factor analyses
(CFA). If the CFAs revealed insufficient fit, malfunctioning items were
deleted. All items were measured on bipolar 7-point scales. Answer
options were visualized as follows: -3 (<em>strongly disagree</em>), -2
(<em>disagree</em>), -1 (<em>slightly disagree</em>), 0
(<em>neutral</em>), +1 (<em>slightly agree</em>), +2 (<em>agree</em>),
+3 (<em>strongly agree</em>). For the analyses, answers were coded from
1 to 7. All items measuring the same variable were presented in
randomized order on the same page.</p>
<p>All measures showed high factorial validity. For an overview of the
means, standard deviations, factorial validity, and reliability, see
Table @ref(tab:CFA). For the variables’ distributions, see Figure
@ref(fig:corrplot). For all items and their distributions, see <a

<p> </p>
<p><em>Privacy concerns</em> were measured with seven items based on
<span class="citation">Buchanan et al. (2007)</span>. One example item
was “When using the participation platform, I had concerns about my
privacy”. One item was deleted due to poor psychometric properties. The
mean was <em>m</em> = 3.21. This value is below the scale’s midpoint of
4, showing that on average people were not strongly concerned about
their privacy.</p>
<p>Two types of gratifications were collected. <em>General
gratifications</em> were measured with five items based on <span
class="citation">Sun et al. (2015)</span>. One example item was “Using
the participation platform has paid off for me”. Based on <span
class="citation">Scherer and Schlütz (2002)</span>, <em>specific
gratifications</em> were measured on five dimensions with three items
each. Example items were: “Using the participation platform made it
possible for me to” … “learn things I would not have noticed otherwise”
(information), “react to a subject that is important to me” (relevance),
“engage politically” (political participation), “try to improve society”
(idealism), and “soothe my guilty consciences” (extrinsic benefits). The
means for both dimensions were <em>m</em> = 4.76 (general
gratifications) and <em>m</em> = 4.71 (specific gratifications), which
were above the scales’ midpoint. This shows that on average people
considered the website to be beneficial.</p>
<p><em>Privacy deliberation</em> was measured with five self-designed
items. One example item was “While using the participation platform I
have weighed the advantages and disadvantages of writing a comment.” The
mean lay on the scale’s neutral midpoint (<em>m</em> = 3.93). (For an
interpretation, see below.)</p>
<p><em>Self-efficacy</em> was captured with six self-designed items,
which measured whether participants felt that they had sufficient
self-efficacy to write a comment on the website. For example, “I felt
technically competent enough to write a comment.” Two inverted items
were deleted due to poor psychometric properties. People felt
self-efficacious to use the website (<em>m</em> = 5.21).</p>
<p>Two types of trust were measured. <em>General trust</em> was
operationalized based on <span class="citation">Söllner, Hoffmann, and
Leimeister (2016)</span>, addressing three targets (i.e., provider,
website, and other users), measured with one item each. One example item
was “The operators of the participation platform seemed trustworthy.”
<em>Specific trust</em> was operationalized for the same three targets
with three sub-dimensions each (i.e., ability, benevolence/integrity,
and reliability), measured with one item each. Example items were “The
operators of the participation platform have done a good job” (ability),
“The other users had good intentions” (benevolence/integrity), “The
website worked well” (reliability). Participants placed a lot of trust
in the website, the providers and the other users (trust general:
<em>m</em> = 5.08; trust specific: <em>m</em> = 5.25).</p>
<p><em>Communication</em> was calculated by counting the number of words
each participant wrote in a comment. Communication was zero-inflated and
heavily skewed: While 58 percent did not communicate at all, the maximum
number of words communicated by a single user was 3198 words. On
average, participants wrote 77 words.</p>

<div id="data-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p>As preregistered, all hypotheses and research questions were
initially tested using structural equation modeling with latent
variables. The influence of the three websites was analyzed using
contrast coding. Because the assumption of multivariate normality was
violated, I estimated the models using robust maximum likelihood <span
class="citation">(Kline 2016)</span>. As recommended by <span
class="citation">Kline (2016)</span>, to assess global fit I report the
model’s <span class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>, RMSEA (90% CI),
CFI, and SRMR. To exclude confounding influences, I controlled all
variables for age, gender, and education, which have been shown to
affect both privacy concerns and online communication <span
class="citation">(Masur 2023; Tifferet 2019)</span>. The preregistered
hypotheses were tested with a one-sided significance level of 5%; the
research questions were tested with a two-sided 5% significance level
using family-wise Bonferroni-Holm correction.</p>
<p>As became apparent when analyzing the data, the preregistered
analyses had two major problems. First, communication was zero-inflated
and gamma distributed. Although it is possible to analyze non-normal
data with structural equation modeling, it is recommended to use
analyses that model the variables’ distribution, which can be achieved
with Bayesian hurdle models <span class="citation">(McElreath
2016)</span>. I conclusion, in the exploratory analyses I ran Bayesian
hurdle regression models, modeling the outcome as a zero-inflated gamma
distribution using default (flat) priors <span class="citation">(chains
= 4, iterations = 2,000, warm-up = 1,000, Bürkner 2017)</span>. Second,
in the preregistered analyses several variables were combined that are
theoretically and empirically closely related, leading to
multicollinearity <span class="citation">(Vanhove 2021)</span>. As a
remedy, I adopted a causal modeling perspective, controlling only for
confounders—in this case, age, gender, and education—but not for
mediators <span class="citation">(Rohrer 2018)</span>. To assess the
effects, I tested whether or not the 95% highest density intervals of
the average marginal effects excluded zero. If they excluded zero,
effects can be considered “significant” <span
class="citation">(McElreath 2016)</span>. I also plotted the
distribution of the effects. For more information on the fitted models,
see <a href="https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike">online companion
website</a>.</p>

<p>I first plotted the bivariate relations of all variables (see Figure
@ref(fig:corrplot)). All variables referring to the privacy calculus
demonstrated the expected bivariate relationships with communication.
For example, people who were more concerned about their privacy
disclosed less information (<em>r</em> = -.15). Specific gratifications
predicted communication better than general gratifications (<em>r</em> =
.22 vs. <em>r</em> = .11). The mean of privacy deliberation was
<em>m</em> = 3.93. Altogether, 32% of participants reported having
actively deliberated about their privacy.</p>
<p>The bivariate results showed three large correlations: specific trust
and general gratifications (<em>r</em> = .79), privacy concerns and
privacy deliberation (<em>r</em> = .61), and specific gratifications and
self-efficacy (<em>r</em> = .55). As all six variables were later
analyzed within a single multiple regression, problems of
multicollinearity might occur.</p>
</div>
<div id="preregistered-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Preregistered Analyses</h2>
<p>First, as preregistered I ran a structural equation model with
multiple predictors. The model fit the data okay, <span
class="math inline">\(\chi^2\)</span>(387) = 934.98, <em>p</em> &lt;
.001, CFI = .94, RMSEA = .05, 90% CI [.05, .05], SRMR = .05. Regarding
H1, results showed that gratifications did not predict communication
(<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.02, = -0.04, 95% CI
[-0.19, 0.12], = -0.45, = .327; one-sided). With regard to H2, privacy
concerns did not significantly predict communication (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> &gt; -.01, = -0.01, 95% CI [-0.30,
0.28], = -0.07, = .473; one-sided). RQ1 similarly revealed that privacy
deliberation did not predict communication (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.10, = -0.16, 95% CI [-0.35,
0.02], = -1.76, = .078; two-sided). Regarding H3, however, I found that
experiencing self-efficacy predicted communication substantially (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = .37, = 0.77, 95% CI [0.49, 1.05],
= 5.42, &lt; .001; one-sided). Concerning H4, results showed that trust
was not associated with communication (<span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> = -.03, = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.56,
0.38], = -0.36, = .358; one-sided).</p>
<p>However, these results should be treated with caution. I found
several signs of multicollinearity, evidenced by the large standard
errors or “wrong” and reversed signs of predictors <span
class="citation">(Vanhove 2021)</span>. For example, in the bivariate
analysis trust had a positive relation with communication, whereas in
the multiple regression the effect was negative—which should make us
skeptical.</p>
<p>Next, I analyzed the effects of the popularity cues. It was for
example expected that websites with like buttons would lead to more
communication, more gratifications, more privacy deliberation, and less
privacy concerns. The results showed that the popularity cues had no
effects on communication and on the privacy calculus variables. For an
illustration, see Figure @ref(fig:popularitycues). For the detailed
results of the specific inference tests using contrasts, see <a
href="https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike">companion website</a>.</p>

<div id="exploratory-analyses" class="section level2">
<h2>Exploratory Analyses</h2>
<p>As explained above, the preregistered results were problematic.
Communication was not normally distributed and the predictors were
collinear. I hence updated the analyses, using Bayesian hurdle models
controlling only for confounders but not mediators. The updated
exploratory analyses showed different results.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</div>
<p>Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all confirmed: If participants
expected more gratifications from participation, they communicated more
actively: If their expected gratifications increased by one point, on
average they also wrote 27 words more (95% HDI: 13, 43). If participants
were more concerned about their privacy, they communicated less: With
each one-point increase in privacy concerns, on average they wrote 16
words less (95% HDI: -28, -6). If participants felt more
self-efficacious, they communicated much more: If their self-efficacy
increased by one point, on average they wrote 73 words more (95% HDI:
55, 95). The relationship was curvilinear, almost exponential: Whereas a
change in self-efficacy from 1 to 2 only led to an “increase” of 0
words, a change from 6 to 7 led to an increase of 103 words. Next, if
participants experienced more trust in the website, provider, and other
users, they also communicated much more: If their trust increased by one
point, on average they wrote 31 words more (95% HDI: 14, 53). The first
research question asked how privacy deliberation would affect
communication. The results revealed a negative effect. The more people
deliberated about their privacy, the less they communicated. If privacy
deliberation increased by one point, on average they wrote 33 words less
(95% HDI: -51, -20).</p>

<p><em>Note.</em> HDI = highest density interval, LL = lower level; UL =

</div>
<p> </p>
<p>I then reanalyzed the effects of the popularity cues on
communication. Compared to the control condition without popularity
cues, implementing like buttons did not significantly affect
communication, <em>b</em> = -35 (95% HDI: -77, 2). But note that the
effect was very close to not including the zero. However, implementing
both like and dislike buttons affected communication. Contrary to what I
expected, implementing both popularity cues <em>decreased</em>
communication. If both popularity cues were present, participants on
average wrote 47 words less (95% HDI: -91, -11). The introduction of
both cues hence led to a 45% decline in number of words that were
written.</p>
<p>Finally, I tested if the effect of the popularity cues on
communication were potentially mediated by the privacy calculus
variables. Results showed that this was not the case. The popularity
cues only affected behavior, but not the predictors of the privacy
calculus model (see <a
href="https://XMtRa.github.io/like_dislike">online companion
website</a>). The results suggest that the effect was either direct or
mediated by other variables not included here <span
class="citation">(Coenen 2022)</span>.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>This study analyzed whether the privacy calculus can be replicated
with behavioral data in an authentic setting; if the model needs to be
extended theoretically; and whether like and dislike buttons affect
online communication and the privacy calculus. To this end, a
preregistered field experiment was conducted, which lasted one week. The
privacy calculus model was extended: The privacy deliberation processes
was tested explicitly, and trust and self-efficacy were included as
predictors.</p>
<p>The preregistered analyses showed that the popularity cues did not
affect communication. Only trust emerged as a significant predictor of
online communication. All other variables remained insignificant.
However, the preregistered analyses have to be treated with caution. The
predictors were collinear, which makes their integration in one single
model problematic <span class="citation">(Vanhove 2021)</span>. In
addition, the main variable and outcome of the study, number of
communicated words, was zero-inflated and gamma distributed, which
requires a different type of analysis. The preregistered analyses using
structural equation modeling with multiple predictors were hence
problematic.</p>
<p>To address these issues, I conducted Bayesian hurdle-gamma models
(see section Data analysis). This updated approach changed the results.
People who were more concerned about their privacy wrote fewer words. To
illustrate, people who reported being very much concerned posted only 33
words on average, whereas people who reported being not concerned posted
116 words. People who experienced privacy concerns hence differed
strongly in their communication behavior from people who were
unconcerned. Participants who received more gratifications wrote
substantially more words. The effect was even larger, almost twice as
large. For each point-increase in gratifications, participants wrote 27
words more. Attaining benefits online is hence a strong predictor of
online communication. Together, the results provide further support for
the privacy calculus and against the privacy paradox <span
class="citation">(Baruh, Secinti, and Cemalcilar 2017; Dienlin
2019)</span>. Communication online does not seem to be overly illogical.
To large extents, it is aligned with respondents’ concerns and
benefits.</p>
<p>Results showed that trust and self-efficacy were important drivers of
online communication. Participants who placed more trust into the
website, the providers, and the other community members communicated
more actively. Interestingly, self-efficacy was the strongest of all
predictors. Participants who felt more self-efficacious disclosed much
more than others. To illustrate, if people reported no self-efficacy,
they wrote only 1 word on average. However, when they reported high
levels of self-efficacy, they wrote 254 words. This finding further
supports the underlying premise of bounded rationality <span
class="citation">(Simon 1990)</span>. Although more rational aspects
such as costs and benefits influence behavior, behavior is also
determined by more socio-psychological variables such as trust and
self-efficacy. The findings are also aligned with the technology
acceptance model, which states that online behavior is most strongly
determined by usefulness and ease of use <span
class="citation">(Venkatesh et al. 2003)</span>—two variables closely
related to gratifications and self-efficacy.</p>
<p>The privacy calculus was criticized for not explicitly analyzing the
process of weighing pros and cons before disclosing <span
class="citation">(Knijnenburg et al. 2017)</span>. In this study, I thus
elaborated on the privacy deliberation process. The results showed that
only one third of all participants agreed to have actively weighed the
benefits and risks before communicating on the platform. This figure is
comparatively low. Even in new online contexts, the majority of users
does not seem to actively deliberate about their online communication,
suggesting that online use is to large extents implicit <span
class="citation">(Acquisti, Brandimarte, and Loewenstein
2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, and perhaps also somewhat surprisingly, privacy
deliberation and privacy concerns were strongly correlated (<em>r</em> =
.61). If we are concerned, we also think and deliberate more about our
privacy. And if we are not concerned, we do not deliberate. This finding
can be aligned with decision theory <span class="citation">(Elsbach and
Barr 1999)</span>: When being concerned, we are in a negative state; and
when in a negative state, we judge more critically. At this point, it is
still unknown if thinking about privacy increases concerns or,
conversely, if growing more concerned about privacy makes us deliberate
more carefully.</p>
<p>The updated results showed that implementing both like and dislike
buttons decreased communication. This was an unexpected and interesting
finding. It suggests that negative feedback, or even only risks of
negative feedback, stifles communication. The effect was strong:
Implementing both like and dislikes cues led to a 45% decrease in number
of written words. When compared to the privacy calculus variables, we
see that the effect is of similar size: Growing a bit more concerned or
receiving less gratifications have a comparable impact on behavior. This
finding is aligned with studies reporting strong effects of popularity
cues on behavior <span class="citation">(Muchnik, Aral, and Taylor
2013)</span>.</p>
<p>The negative effects of dislike buttons might help explain why almost
all existing successful social network sites have chosen to omit
negative popularity cues. At the time of writing, only a handful of
websites have (partially) implemented dislike buttons (e.g., youtube,
stackexchange, or reddit). Despite the positivity bias of social media
<span class="citation">(Schreurs, Meier, and Vandenbosch 2022)</span>,
chances of receiving negative feedback and communication are real, as
can be seen by moral outrages or “shit-storms”. Explicit negative
popularity cues are low threshold paralinguistic affordances <span
class="citation">(Carr, Hayes, and Sumner 2018)</span>. They likely
prime or trigger negative experiences or expectations, thereby stifling
communication. Interestingly, however, they did not affect the privacy
calculus variables, and no indirect effect was found. Hence, the effect
is either transmitted via variables not included here <span
class="citation">(Coenen 2022)</span>, or perhaps subconscious and
direct.</p>
<p>Websites only including like buttons had no effect on the number of
communicated words. If anything, there was an unexpected
(non-significant) trend toward reduced communication. Although one might
expect that like buttons, being positive feedback cues, increase
communication, it is also plausible that they can decrease
communication. Not receiving any likes can be perceived as ostracizing
<span class="citation">(Schneider et al. 2017)</span>. In the context of
this study, participants discussed a political topic. Here, not
receiving likes might be even more threatening and intimidating than on
regular social media, where it is more common to discuss every-day and
low-threshold topics. Although like buttons are commonplace in social
media, the findings suggest that in specific contexts they inhibit
communication.</p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The main implications and results discussed above rest on exploratory
analyses not registered a priori. Exploratory analyses are part of the
research process, compatible with preregistration, and important for
scientific progress <span class="citation">(Dienlin et al. 2021)</span>.
The updated analyses represent and document a learning process, which
arguably led to an improved analysis. However, the results should still
be considered somewhat preliminary, to be confirmed in subsequent
studies.</p>
<p>Whereas the effects of the popularity cues on all variables can be
interpreted from a causal perspective (but see below), more caution is
needed regarding the effects of the privacy calculus variables on
communication. Although the effects were controlled for age, gender, and
education, other variables not included here could potentially bias the
causal estimates <span class="citation">(Coenen 2022)</span>. In
addition, in order not to reveal the study intention the self-reported
measures were collected after the field phase. Demand effects might have
led participants to align their answers to their prior behavior. As a
result, the coefficients might overestimate the actual effects.</p>
<p>In experiments only the treatment variable should be manipulated,
while all others should be held constant <span
class="citation">(assumption of stable unit treatment, Kline
2016)</span>. Being a field experiment, several variables could not be
held constant, such as the content of communication by other users, the
unfolding communication dynamics, and the characteristics of other
users. Future research should repeat the design, preferably using
several runs of the same experiment, to further assess generalizability
and robustness.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This study provides further support for the privacy calculus model
and against the privacy paradox approach. Expected benefits, privacy
concerns, comparing benefits and risks, trust, and self-efficacy all
affected communication. Like and dislike buttons reduced communication
significantly. Users can be considered proactive and reasonable. But,
similar to everyday offline contexts, they are also affected by the
affordances of their environment, and often act implicitly without
pondering the consequences of their actions.</p>
